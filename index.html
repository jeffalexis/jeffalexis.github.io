Sift the flour, salt and put into a mixing bowl. (Wash hands really well and dry well ) <br><br>Chop up the fat and rub it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Do not ‘melt the butter’ with your fingers.<br>Make a well in the center and pour in most of the liquid. Mix to a soft spongy dough, adding more liquid as needed. Turn on to a well floured board and quickly knead out any cracks to make a smooth dough.<br>Pat out dough, or roll lightly, until 3/4 inch thick. Cut into rounds with a floured scone cutter 2 ½ inches wide or a open can on a baking sheet. Reshape remaining dough into a ball, <br>flatten slightly, cut into quarters.

Bake near the top of the oven for 7 to 10 minutes until the scones are well risen and golden brown. Remove from the oven and wrap in a tea cloth if to be served hot, or cool on a wire tray.<br><br>

 GINGER BEER
 </h3>From: Tracey Pera<br>Serves: 12 bottles<br>	<br>3 T lemon juice		7 C filtered water		⅛ t yeast	<br><br>Syrup:<br>1 C sugar			½ C water			2 T ginger, grated<br><br>Peel a chunk of the ginger with the tip of a teaspoon—the papery skin scrapes right off—and grate the ginger, using the fine side of your grater. Place the ginger, sugar, and water in a saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to steep for an hour.  Strain the mixture (discard the ginger solids) and allow to cool. <br>You’ve now made ginger syrup (or gingerette, as the Brits call it). Stop right here if you’re looking for a short-cut to ginger ale and you don’t want to mess around with the fermentation process. Pour three or four tablespoons (more or less depending upon how gingery you like it) of your syrup over ice and add 8 ounces of seltzer water or club soda. Bottle the rest of the syrup and store it in the refrigerator.  <br>For the full ginger beer experience, place a funnel in the top of the bottle. Sprinkle the yeast in, followed by the syrup, lemon juice, and water. <br>Put the lid on the bottle and stir the concoction until the yeast is dissolved. Stow it on a shady shelf or in your pantry out of direct sunlight for 2-3 days, or until fizz is achieved with the lid on LOOSELY. At this point it is ready to drink, and must be stored in the refrigerator to prevent further fermentation. Don't forget about the bottle, hidden in the corner, or the pressure will build up so much that it may explode!<br>As with any yeast-powered beverage, the fermentation process continues unless you prevent it from happening. Refrigerating will slow the process down but not stop it completely, that's why it’s best to treat ginger beer as a perishable beverage. Consume within 1-2 weeks. <br><br>
